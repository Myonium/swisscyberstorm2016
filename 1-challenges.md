<h2>Why this Challenge?</h2>
Switzerland lacks sufficient IT security professionals to protect its IT. With the Swiss Cyber Storm Cyber Security Challenge we help to mitigate this problem by offering a platform for finding cyber talents aged 14 to 30 years and by making the cyber security topic more popular among them. Furthermore, we offer successful participants to become part of our
Swiss Whitehatters Academy
where they can participate in networking and continuing education events.
