  abstract: "New vulnerabilities and attacks based on them are always ahead of the protection methods. 
How to identify which threats are most relevant and can be directed against you tomorrow? Are the hackers really as scary as people speculate? 
We explored the services available on the black market of cybercrime in Russia and the CIS and found a lot of very nice services like purchasing 
and renting of botnets, personal malware, DoS attacks, hacking of private and corporate emails, etc... and decided to test these services to get 
the real picture of the methods hackers use and to know the costs of such attacks."
