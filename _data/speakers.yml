  abstract: "Taking your IT security to the next level, you have to consider a paradigm shift. In the past companies mostly invested resources to try to avoid security violations. Nowadays you have to face the inevitable: a security breach can’t be fully prevented. You need to be able to detect it as quick as possible to stop it in its early stages. You need a multi-layer defense strategy to detect attacks and secure your company, a combination of various sensors to improve transparency. Based on our experience managing Security Monitoring for various Swiss companies we will share insights with you how to tackle this.<br>
  <ul><li>Different types of attacks. What can be detected at which stage of the attack?</li>
  <li>Detection tools and methods. When to use automated alarming, when to rely on security staff.</li>
  <li>How to integrate tools into your internal organization? Impacts on your daily business.</li></ul>"

"
  abstract: "New vulnerabilities and attacks based on them are always ahead of the protection methods. 
How to identify which threats are most relevant and can be directed against you tomorrow? Are the hackers really as scary as people speculate? 
We explored the services available on the black market of cybercrime in Russia and the CIS and found a lot of very nice services like purchasing 
and renting of botnets, personal malware, DoS attacks, hacking of private and corporate emails, etc... and decided to test these services to get 
the real picture of the methods hackers use and to know the costs of such attacks."

- speaker: Thom Langford
  jobtitle: CISO
  affiliation: Publicis Group
  title: "Flushing Away Preconceptions of Risk"
  profile: "As Chief Information Security Officer of Publicis Groupe, Thom is responsible for all aspects of information security risk and compliance as well as managing the Groupe Information Security Programme. Additionally the role is responsible for  business continuity capabilities across the Groupe’s global operations. Having successfully built security and IT programmes from the ground up Thom brings an often opinionated and forward thinking view of security risk, both in assessments and management, but is able to do so with humour and pragmatism (mostly). An international public speaker and award winning security blogger, Thom contributes to a number of industry blogs and publications. Thom is also the sole founder of Host Unknown, a loose collective of three infosec luminaries combined to make security education and infotainment films.  Thom can be found online at both thomlangford.com and @thomlangford  on Twitter."
  abstract: "Risk is often seen as a dirty word in business. It is a thing that needs to be reduced to nothing, and has no possible good use in an organization, especially a security programme.<br><br>
This couldn’t be more wrong! Risk is an inherent part of any business, and yet it is often poorly recognized and leveraged in the security organisation. In this presentation Thom will look at three areas of the risk conundrum to open the veil on the elusive art of understanding and ultimately measuring risk:
<ol><li>The initial interpretation of risk and how it is often misunderstood.</li>
<li>The measurement of risk, and how some systems work and other don’t.</li>
<li>The effective treatment of risk, and how sometimes the obvious thing to do can be the wrong thing to do.</li></ol>
With the use of analogies and examples, the audience will appreciate that risk assessment, measurement and management is not always as straightforward as it might first seem. The audience will leave with a new appreciation of how risk can be leveraged for good, and not just perceived as bad."

  abstract: "A moderately-sized institution of higher learning receives an ominous threat from a shadowy hacker group. A plucky band of misfits, armed only with open source forensic tools is the college’s only hope. What happens next? Will our brave band of heroes be able to stop the cyber terrorists in time? <br><br>
This talk will give you a good understanding of the new features in the Plaso and Timesketch forensic tools, as well as an insight into some of the analysis processes these tools enable. Rather than just talking about these features, you’ll see how they’re actually deployed in an investigative context."

While many boards of directors are beginning to ask probing questions about the cyber threat, not enough are engaging this issue adequately.
This is a discussion of what boards need to know in order to more effectively managed the cyber risk, which now qualifies as one of the more 
critical threats most any board will face."

  profile: "<strong>Patrick Miller</strong> is a security executive who has dedicated his career to the protection and defense of the nation’s critical energy infrastructure. He is the founder of EnergySec, and currently its President and CEO. This nonprofit information sharing organization began as a few colleagues meeting for lunch and has grown into a nationwide effort to promote sound security principles in the energy industry. <br>One of his strengths is the diversity of his professional experience. In Energy, he has held positions with a utility, a regulator, and a private consulting firm. He has also held key positions in the Insurance, Internet and Telecommunications sectors. Among other credentials he holds the CISA, CRISC and CISSP certifications. <br>Patrick is an active member of several critical infrastructure security working groups and a sought after speaker and industry expert on the subjects of critical infrastructure protection, process control system security, regulatory compliance, audit, and privacy."
  abstract: "Threat Intelligence Sharing is being called the Holy Grail of cybersecurity by many. It is also being called the Flavor of the Month by others. Does it really provide the promised value? How does an organization know whom to trust, when to share and how to transform the endless flood of security data into actionable information? Whether your intel sharing/gathering is peer to peer, public/private, commercial service or open source - there is a risk of realizing the quote from Aristotle: 'the more you know the more, the more you don’t know.’ Get the most out of your cybersecurity situational awareness efforts by learning from the successes and failures on the front lines of global critical infrastructure organizations."
