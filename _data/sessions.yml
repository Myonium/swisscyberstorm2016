  title: "Lessons from Billions of Breached Records"
  subtype: keynote
  speakers: [hunt]
  description: "What motivates attackers to dump data publicly? How is it sold, traded and redistributed and for that matter, what even causes people to go public with it? These are all questions I’ve dealt with over the years running the ethical data breach search service “Have I been pwned”. It’s also given me the opportunity to interact with everyone from the attackers breaching these systems to the impacted organisations to law enforcement agencies.  <br><br> In this talk, I'll share the lessons learned from working with billions of publicly dumped records as a result of major data breaches. The talk sheds light on how this class of adversary operates and the weaknesses within organisations they continually manage to exploit. It's a unique inside look at security from a very real world and very actionable perspective."

  title: "Exploiting Software Without Bugs"
  subtype: presentation
  speakers: [bos]
  description: "In this talk I will look at new types of vulnerabilties that may have disastrous consequences, but for which it is difficult to point at any particular bug in the software stack. In particular, I will discuss how Google allows attackers that compromise your PC to also own your phone (thereby killing SMS-based two-fact authentication), a new attack on Windows-based systems that allows an attacker to completely pwn the latest Microsoft Edge browser with all defenses up, as well a Linux installations in the cloud, all while not using a single software bug. The goal of this talk is to show that any sufficiently advanced attack is indistinguishable from magic."

  subtype: presentation
  description: "What is the sociological background of commercial cybercrime?
Which players are involved in the darknet? How do they organise
themselves? How are they finalising the transactions and how
do they exchange money and goods? (Unless they do not trade goods, 
but illegal services like assassinations of course.)
Scip is constantly monitoring and analysing the darknet; assessing
the black markets for drugs, weapons, data and crime-on-demand.
This talk is a report about this work."

  subtype: presentation
  description: "In past couple of years the World has started moving towards Mobility. The applications and gadgets using those applications have seen to be growing exponentially. This has also brought endless possibilities of Security Breaches. <br>
This is the World of <b>Mobile Warfare</b>. We have seen recent cases where even LEA (Law Enforcement Agencies) is trying to break into your phone and monitor all your activities. Our smart-wearable store all our personal data like health data, which can be used to carry out a targeted Chemical attack (think about it).
On a bigger picture, what if Smart Weapons being used in a country’s defense are compromised? What is health related data of our soldiers is leaked? Smart gadgets are built for good purpose, but can it not be misused for massive destruction? <br>
Hear me in detail only at Swiss Cyber Storm 2016 "

  subtype: presentation
  speakers: [barwinski]
  description: "What used to be single device, event driven cyber forensic investigations has rapidly evolved to sustained global hunting operations across large networks with tens or hundreds of thousands of endpoints. Adversary hunting activities across the World is relatively simple when one organization operates under unified laws, regulations, policies and processes. However, global corporate enterprises operate with a variety of very distinct environments, subject to local regulations and distinct business unit priorities, policies, processes and business practices. In this digital landscape, investigating and recovering from a significant compromise can pose unexpected additional challenges. Join Mark as he dissects such an incident, exploring real world experiences towards the eradication of unwelcome guests."

  description: "Military Information and Communication Systems are increasingly interconnected and use the similar when not the same components of civilian systems. Cyber-Incidents on military systems are thus technically very similar. Decision processes and impact of incidents are on the other side quite different. Examples of international trainings and exercises on the technical and operative level will be presented."
